								Environmental Conservation is a program of global significance carried out on a local scale. Interlocking global environmental conservation concerns such as global climate change, deforestation, ocean acidification, diminishing biodiversity, environmental degradation, and depletion of fresh water reserves all depend on research, remediation and educational efforts carried out on a local scale.
								</p>
								<p>
								In our environmental conservation placements, volunteers will work with prominent institutions and agencies concerned with the unique conservation issues of the local region, working closely with local staff and students. Depending on the local problems these institutions are trying to address, volunteers will work on programs as diverse as reforestation, maintaining nurseries growing endangered local plant species for the purpose of reintroducing them into the local ecosystem, the collection and analysis of organic material, taking water samples, monitoring local flora and fauna populations, and participating in educational programs aimed at raising environmental conservation consciousness in the local community.

										The Maya Agriculture and Native Construction project provides volunteers a one-of-a-kind opportunity to live and work in the beginning stages of a sustainable organic farm and ecological center. The center is located on the banks of the 2nd largest freshwater lagoon in Mexico. Volunteers will learn about permaculture, ecological construction, environmental conservation, and sustainable living. You will assist with a thoughtful project that can have a meaningful impact to an area threatened by climate change and ill thought-out tourism. Volunteers will receive supervision and direction with 24-hour support and guidance. Our local team has years of experience in volunteerism, horticulture and construction in the Yucatan Peninsula. In brief, you’ll be in good hands.
										</p>
										<p>
										Maya agriculture work includes establishing forest paths, labeling natives plants, building irrigation systems, sowing and sorting seeds, monitoring wildlife around the lagoon, digging and replanting indigenous plant species, and developing plant beds in forest clearings by using methods of composting. The Native Construction project will focus on building permanent structures to house a research center and accommodate future volunteers. Volunteers will work side-by-side with local Mayans who will teach about native building methods using mostly natural materials such as wood, palm leaves, and mud. Think about learning and using ancient indigenous technologies.
										</p>
										<p>
										Volunteers will live in tents on the picturesque banks of the Bacalar Lagoon. The campsite is very simple and includes access to the main road, a small kitchen to prepare meals, rustic bathrooms, and a dock with lagoon access for swimming and bathing.
										</p>
										<p>
										In their free time, volunteers will be able to explore the local town of Bacalar, which has a population of around 12,000. Bacalar is becoming an increasingly popular destination adjacent to the Maya Riviera – 30 minutes from the city of Chetumal, which sits on the border between Belize and Mexico and has a mall and movie theater. Bacalar is about one hour from Mahahual, a very beautiful beach town on the edge of the Caribbean Sea. Volunteers can take advantage of the center’s location on the Lagoon to swim in the fresh waters of the lagoon, go on trips to local freshwater cenotes and smaller Mayan ruins, and practice Spanish with the local community.

										We use the term Maya Agriculture to describe a process of food production encompassing the following principles:
										</p>
										<p><li>The application of ecology to the design and management of sustainable agroecosystems.
										</p></li>
										<p><li>A whole-systems approach to agriculture and food systems development based on traditional knowledge, alternative agriculture, and local food system experiences.
										</p></li>
										<p><li>Linking ecology, culture, economics, and society to sustain agricultural production, healthy environments, and viable food and farming communities.
										</p></li>	
										<p>
										The Maya Agriculture project provides volunteers with a unique opportunity to work on sustainable farming and reforestation within rural, contemporary Mayan communities. Volunteers should be prepared to work hard, get dirty and be flexible with the tasks they are assigned.
										</p>
										<p>
										Volunteers should be in good physical shape. Day-to-day tasks can include maintaining gardens, sowing seeds, producing compost, harvesting and processing produce, building irrigation systems, labeling native plants and trees for educational purposes, building rudimentary structures, and replanting indigenous plant species. This work is very rewarding and educational, but can be tiring for the volunteer.
										</p>
										<p>
										Volunteers seeking further interaction within the community may be able to participate in childcare, teaching English, or teaching any other craft in which they have competence. The growers on all placements go out of their way to provide recreational and educational opportunities to the volunteers, including outings to local cenotes (sink holes), touring local landmarks, and attending local cultural events.
										</p>
										<p>
										***Please note that this project has a minimum stay requirement of 2 weeks and a one time surcharge of $65USD to cover the training and resources in this project.

										This program gives volunteers a unique opportunity to work with a variety of activities with the Yucatan’s most prominent research institutions and work side-by-side with local staff, volunteers and students from all over Latin America.
										</p>	
										<p>
										Volunteers are needed to help maintain to their full potential plant nurseries, gardens and greenhouses dedicated to the re-introduction of endangered indigenous plant species, participate in fieldwork and laboratory work aimed at gathering data to assess the health of the Yucatan’s natural environment; and to assist with educational programs, conservation projects, and recreational activities for the surrounding community. The volunteers help is essential to fill the labor gap that these projects have in their research and educational programs due to the lack of sufficient grant funding and financial support.
										</p>
										<p>
										The day-to-day work varies according to the needs of the institutions, the season of the year, the number of volunteers available, and the level of education and relevant experience the volunteers bring to the program. Please note that there is a 2 week minimum requirement for Environmental Research placements.
